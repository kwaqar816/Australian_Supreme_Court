## Project Description
This project focuses on collecting, cleaning, and visualizing publicly available data from the Australian Supreme Court. The data may include various aspects such as case information, judgments, court proceedings, and more.

## Data Sources
The data for this project was obtained by scraping publicly available information from the official Australian Supreme Court website. Please ensure that you comply with all relevant legal and ethical guidelines when using this data.

## Data Scraping
The data scraping was carried out using Python, and the code for scraping the data can be found in the [scraping_scripts](/scraping_scripts) directory. Detailed information on how to replicate the data scraping process is provided in the documentation within that directory.

## Data Cleaning
The raw data obtained from the scraping process can be messy and unstructured. The data cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed using Python and pandas. The cleaned datasets can be found in the [cleaned_data](/cleaned_data) directory, along with documentation describing the cleaning process.

## Data Visualization
The cleaned data was further analyzed and visualized using Microsoft Power BI to derive insights and create interactive visualizations. The Power BI files and generated visualizations can be found in the [power_bi_visualizations](/power_bi_visualizations) directory.
